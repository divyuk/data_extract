KEY POINTS
1. Q2 When to use a tuple vs list vs dictionary in Python? EARLY
2. Use a tuple to store a sequence of items that will not change.
3. Use a list to store a sequence of items that may change.
4. Use a dictionary when you want to associate pairs of two items.
5. Question: What is the major difference between tuples and lists in Python?
6. Answer: There are several major differences between tuples and lists in Python, which include the following:
7. Tuples
8. Lists
9. Tuples are similar to a list, but they are enclosed within parenthesis, unlike the list.
10. The list is used to create a sequence.
11. The element and size can be changed.
12. The element and size cannot be changed.
13. They cannot be updated.
14. They can be updated.
15. They act as read-only lists.
16. They act as a changeable list.
17. Tuples are surrounded by ( )
18. Lists are surrounded by [ ]
19. Example of Tuple Code is, tup = (1, "a", "string", 1+2)
20. Example of Lists Code is, L = [1, "a" , "string" , 1+2]
21. Question: Define Pass statement in Python?
22. Answer: A Pass statement in Python is used when we cannot decide what to do in our code, but we must type something for making syntactically correct.
23. Question: Draw a comparison between the range and xrange in Python.
24. Answer: In terms of functionality, both range and xrange are identical. Both allow for generating a list of integers. The main difference between the two is that while range returns a Python list object, xrange returns an xrange object.
25. Xrange is not able to generate a static list at runtime the way range does. On the contrary, it creates values along with the requirements via a special technique called yielding. It is used with a type of object known as generators.
26. If you have a very enormous range for which you need to generate a list, then xrange is the function to opt for. This is especially relevant for scenarios dealing with a memory-sensitive system, such as a smartphone.
27. The range is a memory beast. Using it requires much more memory, especially if the requirement is gigantic. Hence, in creating an array of integers to suit the needs, it can result in a Memory Error and ultimately lead to crashing the program.
28. Question: What is Flask and what are the benefits of using it?
29. Answer: Flask is a web microframework for Python with Jinja2 and Werkzeug as its dependencies. As such, it has some notable advantages:
30. Flask has little to no dependencies on external libraries
31. Because there is a little external dependency to update and fewer security bugs, the web microframework is lightweight to use.
32. Features an inbuilt development server and a fast debugger.
33. Question: What is the map() function used for in Python?
34. Answer: The map() function applies a given function to each item of an iterable. It then returns a list of the results. The value returned from the map() function can then be passed on to functions to the likes of the list() and set().
35. Typically, the given function is the first argument and the iterable is available as the second argument to a map() function. Several tables are given if the function takes in more than one arguments.
36. Question: What is Pickling and Unpickling in Python?
37. Answer: The Pickle module in Python allows accepting any object and then converting it into a string representation. It then dumps the same into a file by means of the dump function. This process is known as pickling.
38. The reverse process of pickling is known as unpickling i.e. retrieving original Python objects from a stored string representation.
39. Question: Whenever Python exits, all the memory isn’t deallocated. Why is it so?
40. Answer: Upon exiting, Python’s built-in effective cleanup mechanism comes into play and try to deallocate or destroy every other object.
41. However, Python modules that are having circular references to other objects or the objects that are referenced from the global namespaces aren’t always deallocated or destroyed.
42. This is because it is not possible to deallocate those portions of the memory that are reserved by the C library.
43. Can we reverse a list in Python?
44. def reverse(s):
45. str = ""
46. for i in s:
47. str = i + str
48. return str
49. 2.) Python Enumerate Example:
50. subjects = ('Python', 'Interview', 'Questions')
51. for i, subject in enumerate(subjects):
52. print(i, subject)
53. 3.) Write a Python Program to Find the Second Largest Number in a List?
54. a=[]
55. n=int(input("Enter number of elements:"))
56. for i in range(1,n+1):
57. b=int(input("Enter element:"))
58. a.append(b)
59. a.sort()
60. print("Second largest element is:",a[n-2])
61. 4.)  Write a Python Program to Swap the First and Last Value of a List?
62. a=[]
63. n= int(input("Enter the number of elements in list:"))
64. for x in range(0,n):
65. element=int(input("Enter element" + str(x+1) + ":"))
66. a.append(element)
67. temp=a[0]
68. a[0]=a[n-1]
69. a[n-1]=temp
70. print("New list is:")
71. print(a)
72. Difference Between Multithreading vs Multiprocessing in Python
73. Q1: If a function doesn’t have a return statement, is it valid?
74. Yes, it is valid. By default, all the functions in Python return the particular value “None” unless an explicit return statement is present to return a value that’s not “None”.
75. Q4: Describe compile-time and run-time code checking in Python.
76. Compile-time and run-time code checking is done uniquely in Python and involves first checking a small portion during compile-time checking. Then most other checks like name and type checks happen only during code execution. So referencing a non-existent function in your Python code will still lead it to successful compilation. But your code will fail with an exception only during code execution when the code execution path references the non-existent function.
